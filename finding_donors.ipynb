    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. AdaBoost(Ensemble Methods)\n",
    "   - Application: It is used in text categorization or text tagging which is a process in which the text is analysed then\n",
    "     categorized into predifined groups or tags.\n",
    "   - Strengths: It is simple to implement, and practically performant.\n",
    "   - Weaknesses: It needs a quality dataset, can be affected by noisy data and outliers, needs adjustments for imbalanced       \n",
    "     classes, and performs poorly for insuffiecient data.\n",
    "   - Reasons for my choise: The calssifier uses multiple weak learners to make a very good and strong learner for our problem.\n",
    "     can do feature selection explicitely (we have multiple features in our problem). Adaboost is sensitive to outliers,\n",
    "     however, we used logarismic transformation is used to reduce the effect of outliers. We also have suffiecient data.\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machine(SVM)\n",
    "   - Application: It is used in face recognition.\n",
    "   - Strengths: It has the ability to solve complex problems, performs well with unstrutured and high dimensional data,\n",
    "     produces accurate results, and is memory effecient as its support vectors use a subset of training points.\n",
    "   - Weaknesses: It takes long time in case of large data. It is not easy to understand and  interpret the resulting model and weights. It doesn't perform well in case of overlapping target classes.\n",
    "   - Reasons: The data size is not huge and has several features, so it is sufficient for SVM mthod. \n",
    "3. Logistic Regression\n",
    "   - Application: It is used in filtering spam emails(detect emails are spam or not spam).\n",
    "   - Strengths: It has low variance, less training time, simple to implement, less prone to overfitting in case of low\n",
    "     dimensional dataset with a suffiecient number of training data, high effiecieny if the dataset has linearly separable\n",
    "     features. It is also used as a benchmark to evluate performance of machine\n",
    "     learning models. \n",
    "   - Weaknesses: It's not able to naturally classify multi-class data. It doesn't perform well on correlated attributes, and needs a large dataset with sufficient training examples.\n",
    "   - Reasons: It is chosen as it is fast in prediction. We have sufficient amount of data for training. we only need to classify the data into two classes.  \n",

    "Adaboost is short for adaptive boosting. Adpative model means that it changes its behavior according to the information the model has while running. Boosting is the use of multiple weak classifiers to build a strong classifier. Weak classifiers is model than can perform slighly better than a random guess. Strong learners can performs well and has high accuracy. A weight is a vlaue that decides the importance of a data point. Wrongly classified data are given higher weights for the next iteration. Each iteration the model tries to fit the training data and minimizing the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model works as follows:\n",
    "1. we start with equal weights give to all datapoints and classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The initial classifier classifies the data and model is produced\n",
    "\n",
    "3. then the model is tested to detect misclasified data. The data and given higher weights for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. a weight is assigned for each classifier according to its accuracy and the strong classifier is produced when the process stops\n",
    "\n",
    "5. the process stops either when the error is below certain threshold or the maximum number of estimators is reached \n",
    "\n",
    "The model has predicition speed, and can deal with complex models, however in case if the data is noisy or if there are outliers (datapoints that are abnormal or different from the other data points), the model can perform badly as it may give high weights or importance to the noisy data and outliers.   \n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "- Two out of the five features were sucessfully predicted which are age and hours per week.\n",
    "-  At first, capital loss and gain were surprising factors for me as I think not a lot of people have assets. The capital loss may be important as if the person is losing money, they may not be able to donate money and vice versa in case of capital gain. Education-num is maybe a better indicatior than education, but at the same time it confirms my thoughts about the importance of the level of education in predicting the income. The visulaization also showed that age is an important factor as older people tend to make more money. Hours per week features also is shown to be important and confirmed my thought that the more hours can mean more money making."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
